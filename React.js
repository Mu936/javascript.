1. What is React?
Definition: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs).
Purpose: It helps developers create fast, interactive web applications by allowing them to build UI components.
2. Components
What are Components?
Components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component represents a part of the UI, like a button, form, or an entire page.
Components can be functional (simple functions) or class-based (ES6 classes).
Example of a Functional Component:
javascriptCopy codefunction Greeting() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
 
3. JSX (JavaScript XML)
What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML but allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript.
It makes it easier to visualize the UI structure in your code.
Example:
javascriptCopy codeconst element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
4. Props (Properties)
What are Props?
Props are used to pass data from one component to another, similar to function arguments.
They are immutable, meaning a component cannot change its props.
Example:
javascriptCopy codefunction Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
// Usage<Greeting name="Alice" />
 
5. State
What is State?
State is a built-in object that allows components to manage their own data.
Unlike props, state can be changed within a component.
Example with State (using a class component):
javascriptCopy codeclass Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }
    increment = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div><h1>{this.state.count}</h1><button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button></div>
        );
    }
}
 
6. Lifecycle Methods
What are Lifecycle Methods?
These are special methods in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life, such as when it mounts, updates, or unmounts.
Common Lifecycle Methods:
componentDidMount: Called after the component is added to the DOM.
componentDidUpdate: Called after the component updates.
componentWillUnmount: Called before the component is removed from the DOM.
7. React Hooks
What are Hooks?
Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class.
Common Hooks:
useState: For managing state.
useEffect: For performing side effects (like fetching data).
Example with Hooks:
javascriptCopy codeimport React, { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div><h1>{count}</h1><button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button></div>
    );
}
 
8. Virtual DOM
What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to optimize updates.
When a component's state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, then compares it with the real DOM. This minimizes direct manipulation of the real DOM, leading to better performance.
9. Ecosystem
React Router: A library for routing in React applications, allowing you to navigate between different components.
State Management Libraries: Tools like Redux or MobX to manage complex state across components.
Next.js: A framework for server-side rendering with React, enhancing performance and SEO.
10. Best Practices
Component Design: Keep components small and focused on a single task.
Functional Components & Hooks: Use functional components and hooks for new code to benefit from cleaner syntax and easier state management.
State Management: Use context or state management libraries as your application grows in complexity.
