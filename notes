1.A variable - is a container that holds data values.
Variables allows you to store,update and manipulate information throughout your data.

**Declaring varilable: ways to declare a variable are Var,Let,Const.
*var:function scope and can be declared.
*let:has block scope & can be reassigned but (not declared within the same scope).
*const:has a block scope but(Cannot be reassigned or declared) making it ideal for values that shouldn't be changed.

2.DataTypes: in javascript degfine the type of data that a variable can hold.
There are 5 common datatypes:
-string: A sequence of characters used to  present TEXTS.
-boolen: Represent true/false typically used in conditions and logical operations.
-numbers: Used for numeric values 
-arrays: list of values, which can be any type store din single variable.
-objects: Complex data structure that can hold multiple values and functions as properties

OPERATORS.
----------
Operations are symbols or keywords used to performoperations on values.
They are the building blocks of expression in JavaScript.
1.Arithmetic operations
2.Assignment operators
3.Comparison operators
4.Logical operators- used to combine multiple conditions
       &&(AND), ||(OR), !(NOT).
	   
5.Unary operators
6.Ternary operators

EXPRESSIONS.
------------
Expressions -is a combination of values, varilables and operators that evaluates to single values.
Type of expressions:
1.Arithmetic expressions: used to perform calculations
   ( let total = price* quantinty; )
	
2.Comparison expressions: Use comparison operators to evaluate conditions.
  ( let isAdult = age >= 18; )

3.Logical expressions: Combine multiple conditions using logical operators.


( let canVoe = (age .=18) &&  ( citizen===true )
