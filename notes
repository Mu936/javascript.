1.A variable - is a container that holds data values.
Variables allows you to store,update and manipulate information throughout your data.

**Declaring varilable: ways to declare a variable are Var,Let,Const.
*var:function scope and can be declared.
*let:has block scope & can be reassigned but (not declared within the same scope).
*const:has a block scope but(Cannot be reassigned or declared) making it ideal for values that shouldn't be changed.

2.DataTypes: in javascript degfine the type of data that a variable can hold.
There are 5 common datatypes:
-string: A sequence of characters used to  present TEXTS.
-boolen: Represent true/false typically used in conditions and logical operations.
-numbers: Used for numeric values 
-arrays: list of values, which can be any type store din single variable.
-objects: Complex data structure that can hold multiple values and functions as properties

OPERATORS.
----------
Operations are symbols or keywords used to performoperations on values.
They are the building blocks of expression in JavaScript.
1.Arithmetic operations
2.Assignment operators
3.Comparison operators
4.Logical operators- used to combine multiple conditions
       &&(AND), ||(OR), !(NOT).
	   
5.Unary operators
6.Ternary operators

EXPRESSIONS.
------------
Expressions -is a combination of values, varilables and operators that evaluates to single values.
Type of expressions:
1.Arithmetic expressions: used to perform calculations
   ( let total = price* quantinty; )
	
2.Comparison expressions: Use comparison operators to evaluate conditions.
  ( let isAdult = age >= 18; )

3.Logical expressions: Combine multiple conditions using logical operators.


( let canVoe = (age .=18) &&  ( citizen===true )

The <script> tag
in HTMLthe javascript code is inserted between <script> and </script>

CONTROL STRUCTRES(if-else, switch)
1. 




->DOM.
1.DOM- is a structured representation of an HTML document,
It represents the page so that programs
can change the document structure, style, and content.
->DOM manipulation is a concept allows you to interact with and change 
the HTML and CSS of a webpage using JavaScript



2.SELECTING a DOM elements means targetting specefic parts of html 
documents, so that it can be manupulated with JavaScript.

*Methods for selecting elements:
- document.getElementById();
let heading = document.getElementById("main-heading");
heading.textContent = "My first javascript"; ...//modifying its content

let =document.getElementByClassName("");
let =document.getElementByTagName("");
let =document.querySelector("");
let =document.querySelectorAll("");


** adding a Javascript to a html is called: inline javascript.

2. Modifying DOM elements: once elements are selected they can be 
modified in varioius ways such as,
(changing their Content, Style, Attributes or Structure).

..There are 5 common ways of modifications:
 -> changing content.
 textContent / innerHTML
 Example: heading.textContent = "Welcome";
 
 ->Changing Styles.
 Using the style property to modify css
 Example: element.style.color = "blue";
 paragraph.style.color = "blue";
 
 ->Adding/Removing Classes.
 Adding class= classList.adding
 paragraph.classList.add("highlight");
 Removing class= classList.remove
 
 ->Changing Attributes:
 changing Attributes like src,href,alt- Using setAttributes, removeAttributes.
 
 ->Creating and Inserting Elements:
  To create and insert elements we use
  createElement / appendChild.
  
 |Example:let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
 |newDiv.textContent = "This is a new element.";
 |document.body.appendChild(newDiv);  // 
 
 *---EVENT-HANDLING---*
Event- An event is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, such as a user clicking a button,
typing in a text field, or scrolling a page ,javaScript can detect these events and respond to them,enabling interactive behavior on web pages.
 -> The are common list of HTML Events:
 .0nchange- An HTML element has been changed
 .Onclick- The user clicks html element
 .onmouseover-The user moves the mouse over a HTML element
 .onmouseout-
 .onkeydown- user pushes a keyboard key
 .onload- the browser has finished loading a page
